# Ramen Restaurante FrontEnd Template

This is a Front-End template for the Ramen Restaurante. The main Idea from creating this project is to learn how to use React with Hooks and to get familiar with React Router.
This is a one page website means that there isn't any redirected paths. Also all the Headlines mentioned in the sidebar are directly connected to each corresponding component on the Main Page
